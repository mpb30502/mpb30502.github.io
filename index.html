<h2> Background information</h2>
<h5> Courtesy of Cointelegraph.com</h5>
<p> The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by a pseudonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin uses SHA-256, which is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the U.S National Security Agency. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the proof-of-work system.Cryptocurrencies are the digital media of exchange which use cryptography and shared transaction ledgers to create a secure, anonymous, traceable and potentially stable monetary system.

Cryptocurrencies take their name from their use of cryptography. Cryptography is the study of the methods of encrypting information, primarily with the intention of sending a message securely and privately but also for tasks such as data security and authentication. Crypto, the prefix in both words, comes from the Greek word kruptos, which means “secret.” Cryptocurrencies incorporate many of the technologies and theories developed by cryptographers in order to create a digital money exchange system that is resistant to both censorship and fraud.
</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are backed by math rather than the word of a government or financial institution. While they, like all currencies, still depend on their perceived value, their scarcity is based on math and cannot be adjusted by any one group or person. They are neither tied to the availability of physical goods, such as gold, nor can they be artificially created by governments or financial institutions like dollars can. Bitcoins can be used to buy merchandise anonymously. In addition, international payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value.
</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have the potential to change the financial world and in many ways already have. Bitcoin was the first, remains the largest and has the best chance at achieving mainstream adoption, but there are plenty others with innovative ideas that should not be ignored.</p>
